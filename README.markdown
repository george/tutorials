This is the source material for JumpstartLab tutorials.

## Status

I initially built this with Jekyll, but had too much frustration trying to get the syntax highlighting working properly.

Instead, it will be reorganized using a small Sinatra app to serve parsed and highlighted pages.

The materials are in a mix of Textile and Markdown. I'm working on converting everything to Markdown.

## Usage

For right now, until the Sinatra app is in place, the best way to view the tutorials is by using github's built-in parsing and highlighting. For instance, visit:

https://github.com/JumpstartLab/jumpstartlab_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/rails/jsmerchant/jsmerchant.textile

For the current version of the JSMerchant Tutorial.

## Editing

Please make edits to the original markdown/textile and submit pull requests. I'm currently working through the JSMerchant tutorial. You'll likely find "Jeff's Revision Marker" in the text which is where I've worked up to so far.
