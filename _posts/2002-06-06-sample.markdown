title: "Reversible Migrations"

<span class="version">**Rails** 3.1</span>

Migrations have always been considered one of the many killer features in Rails. And in Rails 3.1 Migrations got a new trick up their sleeve that will greatly simplify the process of maintaining both the `up` and `down` logic. If you need a little refresher on what migrations are then I suggest reading the official [Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html).

Lets start by looking at how a typical migration looks like in Rails 3.0

```ruby
  class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :posts do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.text :body
        
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
    
    def self.down
      drop_table :pos
    end
  end
```
