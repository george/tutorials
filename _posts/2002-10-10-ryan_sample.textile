title: "Prettier Error Pages!"
---
 
This may not seem like a biggie, but we all know you haven't gotten around to prettying up your error pages yet..

"The new, pretty, 404 error page":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/railties/html/404.html?format=raw

and

"The new, pretty, 500 error page":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/railties/html/500.html?format=raw

It's the little things sometimes...
